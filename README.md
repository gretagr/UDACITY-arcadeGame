## About

* This game is made as a project for Udacity front-end developer scholarship by Google.
* Uses starter code provided by Udacity.


## Instructions

Game goal is to move player across the water.

On the lane player can find these collectibles: orange gem - adds 50 points, shining rectangle - will teleport the player to the safe zone (water), heart - adds one life, or adds 20 points, if lives are full.

The player should avoid bugs - collision with a bug removes one life and resets player position back to the grass.

* Or you can download/clone repository and start game by opening index.html file.
* Score panel displays game statistics: timer, lives, and score.
* Timer starts when the user moves the player for the first time.
* Grass and water are safe zones - enemy can't reach you there.
